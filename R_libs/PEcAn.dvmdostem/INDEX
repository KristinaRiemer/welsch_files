adjust.runmask.dvmdostem
                        Adjust runmask for dvmdostem.
convert.samples.dvmdostem
                        Convert samples for dvmdostem
enforce.runmask.cmt.vegmap.harmony
                        Make sure that selected run mask pixel, veg map
                        pixel value and CMT type are all copasetic. The
                        function calls stop() if there is anything
                        inconsistent, for example more tha one pixel is
                        enabled in the run mask, or the enabled pixel's
                        vegetation type does not match the
                        vegetation/community type of the chosen PFTs.
model2netcdf.dvmdostem
                        Code to convert dvmdostem netcdf output into
                        into CF standard
setup.outputs.dvmdostem
                        Setup outputs to be generated by dvmdostem and
                        analyzed by PEcAn.
vmap_reverse            Build a mapping from dvmdostem names to PEcAn
                        names, units, etc. The temunits should be (are)
                        looked up from the dvmdostem output file's
                        units attributes.
write.config.dvmdostem
                        Write dvmdostem model configuration files
write.data2pecan.file   Write data into PEcAn shaped output file.
